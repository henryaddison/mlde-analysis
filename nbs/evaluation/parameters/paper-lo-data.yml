    Models trained on just one ensemble member and one time period vs 12 ensemble members and three time periods
    Splits are based on random choice of seasons with equal number of seasons from each time slice

    Compare:

    ### Diffusion models pSTV
    * 12 ensemble members, three time periods in training data
    * 1 ensemble member, one time period in training data

    Inputs from: pressure at sea level and 4 levels of temp, spec hum and vorticity

    Target domain and resolution: 64x64 2.2km-4x England and Wales

    Input resolution: 60km/gcmx

    Input transforms are fitted on dataset in use (ie separate GCM and CPM versions) while target transform is fitted only at training on the CPM dataset
    NB this does mean the sampling input transform uses training data from all 12 ensemble members and all three time periods for both diffusion models which is not ideal.

    Evaluated on 1 time period (historic) and 1 ensemble member (01) like CPMGEM_ld
